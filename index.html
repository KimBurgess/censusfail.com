        <h1>Worried about your privacy? There's no need to go "camping" this Census.</h1>
        <p>August 9 is Census night. All over Australia families and households will huddle around laptops with poor quality internet connections to answer a series of questions that will provide a snapshot of who we are as a nation. The data collected by the census is invaluable. It provides important statistics about Australia which drive the development of evidence based government policy.</p>
        <p>In previous years, although your name and address were collected, it was not stored. As of this year <em>(2016)</em> things are different &mdash; <strong>your name and address are now stored to enable future linking to other datasets</strong>. The Census has transitioned from anonymous statistics to an identifiable, personal record of every person in the country.</p>

        <p>When your name is stored, it will likely be run through a process that performs a one way encoding known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salting</a>. The <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/privacy">Australian Bureau of Statistics privacy policy</a> refers to this as an <em>`anonymous linkage key`</em>. Anyone with access to this key cannot decode it to reveal your name. However, your name and address can be taken from another source and run through the same encoding process to bring datasets together; linking your census answers with your medical records, international travel or other information of interest.</p>
        <p>Use this handy tool to convert your name and the names of anyone else in your home on census night to a format that can still be read by a human, but cannot be used for automatated linking. This will help you answer the census truthfully, providing valuable statistcs without forfieting your right to privacy.</p>
        <p><em>All conversion takes place locally, in your browser. No names or other information are tranmitted when converting. The source code for this can also be found on <a href="https://github.com/KimBurgess/censusfail.com/tree/gh-pages">GitHub</a>. Feel free to make it better.</em></p>
